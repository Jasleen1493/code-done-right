Epic 1. Record Processing

Stories: 

1. File Validation

Description:
Read new files from new folder and check the format of name of the file. If format of file name matches with the required 
pattern, then file shall be send further for processing, by moving the file into processing folder, else if incorrect format found then
file shall be send to garbage folder.

Acceptance Criteria: 
> Files with correct name formats must be available in processing folder.
> Files with incorrect name formats must be available in garbage folder.

2. File Processing

Description:
A user shall read files from processing folder line wise. Multiple files can be available for processing, which shall process in every 
two hours and can be processed parallely as well.The order of processing must be on the basis of files naming convention, where xxxx
denotes a integer and files having smallest number present in it's name must be processed first. If an issue occurs with record then 
file shall be sent to error folder with same file name with error appended, for example transactions0123-error.csv for file
transactions0123.csv consisting of the error description, else call publishToKafka and write the file to done folder.

Acceptance Criteria:
> Read files from processing folder and process them record by record
> Processing file must be able to call publishToKafka (subject to availability)
> Successful processed records pushed to done folder with correct naming convention
> Erroneous processed records pushed to done folder with correct naming convention

4. Kafka POC
Understanding how kafka works
Setting up kafka on local and publishig and reading from kafka from java code

5. Kafka Publisher

Description:
All processing shall be posted on kafka topic, one topic for transaction and another topic for other entities.Kafka Implementation shall
include Kafka POC completion.

Acceptance Criteria:
> Kafka topics setup
> Integration of kafka with the application
> Create publisher and publish to kafka topic
