Sprint 0: Project Set Up
Stories :
1. Springboot application setup
2. Git operations validation setup (commit, push)
3. CI/CD Setup
4. Code Quality setup 
5. Logging Mechanism

Epic 1. Record Processing

Stories: 

1. File Validation

Description:
A user shall read new file from new folder and check the format of name of the file. If format of file name matches with the required 
pattern, then file shall be send further for processing, by moving the file into processing folder, else if incorrect format found then
file shall be send to garbage folder.

Acceptance Criteria: 
> User must be able to read new file successfully from new folder.
> Files with correct name formats must be available in processing folder.
> Files with incorrect name formats must be available in garbage folder.
> Appropriate logging to be maintained for file read.
> Code quality must suffice the expected quality checks.


2. File Processing

Description:
A user shall read files from processing folder line wise. Multiple files can be available for processing, which shall process in every 
two hours and can be processed parallely as well.The order of processing must be on the basis of files naming convention, where xxxx
denotes a integer and files having smallest number present in it's name must be processed first. If an issue occurs with record then 
file shall be sent to error folder with same file name with error appended, for example transactions0123-error.csv for file
transactions0123.csv consisting of the error description, else call publishToKafka and write the file to done folder.

Acceptance Criteria:
> A file must be read successfully from processing folder, if multiple files present, order of processing must be correctly followed
> Processing file must be able to call publishToKafka
> successful processed file must be available in done folder
> File having issue in reading records from file line wise must be sent to error folder with correct naming convention
> Appropriate logging to be maintained for file read.
> Code quality must suffice the expected quality checks.

3. Kafka Implementation

Description:
All processing shall be posted on kafka topic, one topic for transaction and another topic for other entities.Kafka Implementation shall
include Kafka POC completion.

Acceptance Criteria:
> Transaction types of files must be available on transaction topic
> Other files must be available on another topic other than transaction
> Appropriate logging to be maintained for file read.
> Code quality must suffice the expected quality checks.

Epic 3. Kafka POC
1. Kafka topics setup
2. Integration of kafka with the application
3. Testing of kafka integration
